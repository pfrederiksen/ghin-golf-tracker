OpenClaw skill for analyzing GHIN (Golf Handicap and Information Network) golf statistics and handicap tracking. **Analysis only** - reads local JSON file, no network access or credential handling. Data collection requires separate browser automation (see privacy notes below).

## Features

🏌️ **Comprehensive Golf Analytics**
- Current handicap index with trend analysis (improving/declining/stable based on last 5 revisions)
- Lifetime totals including round counts, best/worst scores
- Best 5 differentials with course and date information
- Most played courses with performance statistics

📊 **Detailed Performance Metrics**
- Year-by-year breakdown of rounds and scoring averages
- Par-specific scoring averages (Par 3, 4, 5) when available
- Performance statistics (GIR%, fairways hit%, average putts)
- Handicap range analysis with historical highs and lows

📈 **Multiple Output Formats**
- Human-readable text reports for quick review
- JSON output for programmatic processing and integration
- Detailed course-by-course performance analysis

🔒 **Privacy-First Design**
- No network connections or external API calls
- No credential storage or authentication required
- Local file processing only
- No data writes or persistent storage

## Installation

## Getting Your GHIN Data

⚠️ **PRIVACY NOTICE**: The following data collection guide involves browser automation with cloud services and credential transmission. Consider privacy implications before proceeding.

GHIN does not offer a public API for score history. To get your data, use browser automation to scrape **https://www.ghin.com**.

### Using browser-use (Privacy Considerations)

**⚠️ External Services Involved:**
- **Cloud browser service** (browser-use API) - receives your GHIN login credentials
- **LLM provider** (OpenAI/Anthropic via ChatBrowserUse) - processes golf data and credentials  
- **GHIN.com** - accessed via cloud browser with your credentials

**Alternative**: For maximum privacy, manually export your GHIN data and create the JSON file locally.

[browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) is an AI-powered browser automation library:

```bash
pip install browser-use langchain-openai
```

```python
import asyncio
from browser_use import Agent, Browser, ChatBrowserUse

async def main():
    # WARNING: This sends your GHIN credentials to cloud services
    browser = Browser(use_cloud=True)  # Cloud browser service
    llm = ChatBrowserUse()  # Requires OpenAI API key
    agent = Agent(
        task="""Log into https://www.ghin.com with my credentials.
        Navigate to Score History. Extract ALL scores across all years
        (cycle through year filters). For each score get: date, score
        with type (A/C/H), course name, course rating/slope, differential.
        Also get current handicap index and revision history.
        Save as JSON to ghin-data.json""",
        llm=llm, browser=browser,
    )
    await agent.run(max_steps=50)

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Credentials Required:**
- GHIN login credentials (transmitted to cloud browser)  
- OpenAI API key (for ChatBrowserUse LLM)
- browser-use cloud service access

### What to scrape

| Section | Data |
|---------|------|
| Score History | Date, score + type, course, CR/slope, differential (per year) |
| Handicap Index | Current index, effective date |
| Revision History | Historical index values with revision dates |

**Tips:** GHIN shows one year at a time — cycle through each year filter to get lifetime data. Score types: `A` = adjusted, `C` = combined 9+9, `H` = home, `Ai` = imputed (exclude from stats).

**Privacy Reminder:** The above method transmits your GHIN credentials and golf data to cloud services. For sensitive data, consider manual data export instead.

## Expected Data Format

The script processes GHIN data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "handicap_index": 18.0,
  "lifetime_rounds": 83,
  "handicap_history": [
    {"date": "2026-02-02", "index": 18.0},
    {"date": "2026-01-15", "index": 17.8}
  ],
  "stats": {
    "par3_avg": 4.06,
    "par4_avg": 4.94,
    "par5_avg": 5.73,
    "gir_pct": 50,
    "fairways_pct": 65,
    "putts_avg": 31.2
  },
  "scores": [
    {
      "date": "2026-02-01",
      "score": "82A",
      "course": "Las Vegas Golf Club",
      "cr_slope": "68.0/117",
      "differential": 13.5
    }
  ]
}
```

## Data Collection

**Important Note**: This skill only processes already-collected GHIN data. It does NOT collect data from GHIN.com itself.

Data collection is handled separately by the OpenClaw agent using browser automation. This separation ensures:
- Better security (no credentials in this skill)
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Offline analysis capabilities
- No rate limiting or blocking concerns

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- ❌ No network access or web scraping
- ❌ No subprocess execution or shell commands  
- ❌ No file writes or data persistence
- ❌ No credential handling or authentication
- ❌ No external API calls or database connections
